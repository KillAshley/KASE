About
-----
KASE is a visual overhaul for KSP. Designed to bring the stock worlds up to the standard we expect without losing their stock feel.

Instructions
------------
Firstly, ensure any older version of KASE and Kopernicus have been removed.

You will need to DELETE (important) the following folders when updating:
- GameData/Kopernicus
- Gamedata/KASE

You will need to download its dependency - Kopenicus. This is required to run the mod.
Just download the latest release and any hotfixes available.

Simply merge the downloaded .zip files into your KSP directory the same as with any other mod.
DO NOT EXTRACT THE .zip FILE STRAIGHT OUT - open it and merge the contents.
This should be all you are required to do for a basic install.

PLEASE REMEMBER TO BACKUP YOUR SAVEGAMES BEFORE INSTALLATION/UPDATING AS BUGS CAN & SOMETIMES DO OCCUR.

If you need to reset your ships landed on planets before/after updating, please use hyperedit as it makes resetting them simple and easy.
